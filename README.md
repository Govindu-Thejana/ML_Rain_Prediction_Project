# Rain Prediction in Galle, Sri Lanka

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting rainfall in Galle, Sri Lanka, using historical weather data spanning from January 1, 2010, to January 1, 2023. The primary objective is to develop a predictive model that assists in managing water resources, agricultural planning, and mitigating weather-related risks.

## Feature Engineering

-Cyclical encoding of month features
-Feature scaling using StandardScaler
-Selection of key features based on correlation analysis

## Hyperparameter Tuning
Best parameters for Random Forest:
{
    'bootstrap': True,
    'max_depth': 10,
    'min_samples_leaf': 4,
    'min_samples_split': 10,
    'n_estimators': 100
}
## Model Comparison

### Key Observations:
- **Performance**: Random Forest significantly outperforms Linear Regression in terms of both R² and error metrics.
- **Overfitting**: While Random Forest shows a high training R²,then hyperparameter tuning prevent overfitting, as evidenced by a consistent testing R².
- **Complexity**: Random Forest captures non-linear relationships better, making it more suitable for this dataset.

### Visualizations:
- Scatter plots comparing actual vs. predicted rainfall indicate a better fit with Random Forest.
- Feature importance analysis in Random Forest highlights key contributors like temperature and precipitation hours.

## Key Results
- Random Forest achieved a higher R² (0.83) on the test set compared to Linear Regression (0.60).
- Feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning further enhanced the model's performance.
